# INTRODUCTION

This repository showcases my learning journey and the Python concepts I’ve explored so far.

## Research and Learning

So far Ive learned about various concepts in Python, including:

- if and else statements  
- elif conditions  
- Classes and objects  
- Functions (def)  
- Attributes  
- The turtle module  
- Tuples  
- Basic input and output  
- Game logic

## Projects I have Made

Here are some small projects and practice files I’ve worked on:

- **Guess Number** – A simple number guessing game using tuple
- **Turtle Game** – A game using the turtle module where you move a turtle to catch a red circle
- **Rock Paper Scissor** – A basic game using if-else statements and user input
- **Arithmetic Equations** – Practice with math operations and expressions
- **Classes and Function Use** – Learning how to create and use classes and functions in Python
- **Other Work** – Various practice programs and experiments

## My Experience

This has been a great learning experience! I now understand how to use classes, functions, and conditions more effectively. I also focus on why things happen in the code, not just how to write them. Python is fun and helps me think logically and creatively.
And also i have also saw other repositories to get better understanding 

## Additional Info

I’ve made a variety of small projects to strengthen my basics. I continue to practice and explore new topics as I go.
