This is a very simple game made with Python and the Turtle module. In this game, you control a green turtle using the arrow keys. You try to catch the red circle. When you catch it, it moves to a new place.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open your code editor or Python environment.
3. Copy the game code into a file (for example: `game.py`).
4. Run the file.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the turtle:
  - Up arrow to move up
  - Down arrow to move down
  - Left arrow to move left
  - Right arrow to move right
- Try to move the green turtle to touch the red circle.
- When you catch it, it jumps to a new random place.
- The game tells you in the console when you catch the target.

## What You Learn

By making this game, you will learn:

- How to use the `turtle` module in Python
- How to draw shapes like turtles and circles
- How to use the keyboard to control objects
